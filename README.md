# Hangman Game
## About
This is a project with focus on parallel programming primitives in order to learn the intricacy of its design.

The goal was to develop a hangman game, however the actual game logic was never implemented since (being a turn based game) it added nothing to the field of practice.
Instead a chatting service, a very primitive ASCII user interface and a game lobby where requests could be issued and accepted was designed and implemented.

At the moment of writting I left it undocumented, and it will remain so, sorry for anyone intending to use it for learning.

# Contact
Thou it is undocumented I would love to turn it into learning material at some point, so if anyone has any questions I'd be glad to go over the code with them just contact me.
